# Apache Iceberg Verification

A verification framework for [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/)
implementations: language-neutral conformance fixtures, and the runners that
exercise them.

## Status

Nightly type-surface conformance per implementation (informational, non-gating):

![iceberg-go](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/<user>/<gistid>/raw/iceberg-go.json)
![iceberg-rust](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/<user>/<gistid>/raw/iceberg-rust.json)
![pyiceberg](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/<user>/<gistid>/raw/pyiceberg.json)
![iceberg-java](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/<user>/<gistid>/raw/iceberg-java.json)

## Motivation

The Iceberg [specification](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/) is prose. Each
implementation parses and serializes it on its own, so they drift. Tests
maintained in isolation in each implementation cannot catch this, because each
checks its own reading of the spec against itself. A shared misreading stays
green and often surfaces only as a post-release bug report.

Expected values here are derived from the spec, not copied from an
implementation, so a fixture catches both implementation bugs and genuine spec
ambiguity. The expected value is single-sourced, so a corrected reading is
corrected in one place.

## Scope

Initial scope is read conformance. A reference writer emits each fixture, and
every implementation verifies that it consumes the fixture correctly. Writer
conformance is a later phase.

This repository validates artifacts, not behavior. Engine query results, live
protocol behavior, and physical encoding choices such as compression codec and
file format writer version are out of scope. Any spec-valid encoding is valid.

Adoption is by self-election and is incremental. An implementation pins this
repository to a commit, runs the surfaces it opts into, and bumps that pin
deliberately. There is no central conformance gate. The nightly status matrix
and the README badges are informational only - they report divergences and
never block any implementation's CI.

Conformance runs at two tiers: spec-derivable surfaces (such as types) are
exercised by the runners here and reported nightly; surfaces that need an
implementation's own internals are subscribed to and run by that implementation
in its own CI. Both tiers read the same fixtures. See
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Contributing

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the repository layout, the two-tier
model, the fixture format, and how to add or correct a fixture or subscribe from
an implementation.
