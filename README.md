# Apache Iceberg Verification

A verification framework for [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/)
implementations, built on language-neutral, spec-derived conformance fixtures.

## Motivation

The Iceberg [specification](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/) is prose. Each
implementation parses and serializes it on its own, so they drift. Tests
maintained in isolation in each implementation cannot catch this, because each
checks its own reading of the spec against itself. A shared misreading goes
unnoticed and often surfaces only as a post-release bug report.

Expected values here are derived from the spec, not copied from an
implementation, so a fixture catches both implementation bugs and genuine spec
ambiguity. The expected value is single-sourced, so a corrected reading is
corrected in one place.

## Scope

Initial scope is read conformance of the type surface. `table-spec/types/` holds
spec-derived fixtures, and each `cases.json` is validated against the JSON Schemas
in `dev/schema/` by `dev/validate-fixtures.py`. Runners that exercise the fixtures
against each implementation, and further surfaces, land in follow-up changes.

This repository validates artifacts, not behavior. Engine query results, live
protocol behavior, and physical encoding choices such as compression codec and
file format writer version are out of scope. Any spec-valid encoding is valid.

## License

Fixture files are test data and carry no license header, per the
[ASF Source Header and Copyright Notice Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html),
which exempts "test data for which the addition of a source header would cause
the tests to fail". Every other file carries the standard ASF source header.
