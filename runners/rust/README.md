# Rust conformance runner

Reference runner that checks [iceberg-rust](https://github.com/apache/iceberg-rust)
against the type-surface fixtures. It reads every `table-spec/**/cases.json`,
deserializes each `input` into iceberg-rust's own `Type` with `serde_json`, and
applies the assertion contract in `table-spec/types/README.md` (`valid`/reject;
decoded-shape compare, no bytes, plus byte-exact `canonical` when the case has it).
It exits non-zero if any case FAILs. See [`../README.md`](../README.md) for the
shared contract that every language runner follows.

## Running it

The runner depends on the `iceberg` crate pinned in `Cargo.toml`; `cargo run`
resolves it from crates.io. CI tests `apache/main` via a git dependency:
`cargo add iceberg --git https://github.com/apache/iceberg-rust --branch main --no-default-features`.

```sh
# from runners/rust (latest release)
cargo run
```

`cargo run` discovers the repository root (the directory containing `table-spec/`)
by walking up, so it works from any working directory. Output is one line per
case plus totals; the exit code is non-zero on any FAIL.

## Expected outcomes

A type iceberg-rust's `Type` enum does not model is reported UNSUPPORTED, not
FAIL. The shipped fixtures exercise this for `unknown`, `geometry`, and
`geography` (iceberg-rust has `struct` / `list` / `map` / `variant` and the v3
`timestamp_ns` / `timestamptz_ns`, but not `unknown` or the geospatial types).

Two cases FAIL today, and these are real iceberg-rust divergences from the
spec-derived expectation, not runner bugs:

- `decimal-precision-over-38` - iceberg-rust accepts `decimal(39, 0)`; the spec
  caps precision at 38.
- `fixed-unterminated` - iceberg-rust accepts the unterminated `fixed[16`.

Both should stay red until iceberg-rust tightens its parser (or the community
decides otherwise).
