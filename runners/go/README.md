# Go conformance runner

Reference runner that checks [iceberg-go](https://github.com/apache/iceberg-go)
against the type-surface fixtures. It reads every `table-spec/**/cases.json`,
parses each `input` with iceberg-go's own type parser, and applies the assertion
contract in `table-spec/types/README.md` (`valid`/reject; decoded-shape compare,
no bytes, plus byte-exact `canonical` when the case has it). It exits non-zero if any case FAILs.

## Where this fits (open question)

The community has not yet decided whether runners live in this repository or in
each implementation's own repo. This runner is committed here so the push-model
CI has something to execute; a consumer may equally vendor the fixtures and run
an equivalent check in its own CI (the pull model). See the proposal.

## Running it

The runner depends on the `iceberg-go` module pinned in `go.mod`; `go run .`
resolves it. CI tests `apache/main` HEAD via `go get github.com/apache/iceberg-go@main`;
run that locally to check the same.

```sh
# from runners/go (latest release)
go mod tidy
go run .
```

`go run .` discovers the repository root (the directory containing `table-spec/`)
by walking up, so it works from any working directory. Output is one line per
case plus totals; the exit code is non-zero on any FAIL.

A type iceberg-go does not model is reported UNSUPPORTED, not FAIL.
